With no suffix/extension, the file most likely contains transactional medication data (e.g., orders or administrations) rather than a dictionary, though ambiguity remains. Medication data is typically treatment-scoped and often recorded at an event/detail level (per order/admin), hence a lower hierarchy level.",
