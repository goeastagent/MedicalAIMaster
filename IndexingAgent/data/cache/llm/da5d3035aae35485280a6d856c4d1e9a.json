The file is wide (74 columns) with many patient/case attributes and perioperative measurements (e.g., case/subject IDs, start/end times, labs, intraop meds/fluids), which is characteristic of transactional/record-level data. Sample values are numeric IDs and measurement-like numbers with short text lengths, not long descriptive definitions typical of metadata.",
