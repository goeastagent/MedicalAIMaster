Suffix 'vitals' indicates vital sign measurements (e.g., HR, BP, temp), which are typically time-stamped transactional records. In a hierarchy, vitals are measurement-level data (level 4), often linked to a stay/admission and possibly to ward/location dimensions and vitals dictionaries/parameter tables.",
