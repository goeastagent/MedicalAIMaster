Suffix 'vitals' indicates vital sign measurements (e.g., HR, BP, temp), which are typically time-stamped transactional records. As vitals are measurements, they fit hierarchy level 4; related patterns likely include ward-level stay/admission/transfer context and vitals metadata (dict/parameters).",
