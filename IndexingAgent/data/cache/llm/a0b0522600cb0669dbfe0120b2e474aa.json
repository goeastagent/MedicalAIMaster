    "reasoning": "Filename 'operations.csv' suggests an events/encounters table rather than a dictionary/codebook. The structure is wide with 29 fields including multiple IDs (op_id, subject_id, hadm_id), demographics (age, sex, weight, height, race), clinical attributes (asa, antype, icd10_pcs), and many timestamps (opstart_time, opend_time, admission/discharge, ICU in/out, death times), which is characteristic of per-operation transactional records. Sample values are numeric IDs and time-like numeric values, not long descriptive text; no columns resemble [field_name, description, unit, type] metadata patterns.",
