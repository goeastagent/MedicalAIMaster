The structure is wide with 29 clinical/event fields (multiple IDs, demographics, procedure codes, and many timestamps like opstart_time/opend_time, admission/discharge, ICU in/out, death times), which is characteristic of transactional records. Sample values for op_id/subject_id/hadm_id are numeric identifiers, and there are no long descriptive text fields or columns like description/unit/type that would indicate a codebook/metadata file.",
