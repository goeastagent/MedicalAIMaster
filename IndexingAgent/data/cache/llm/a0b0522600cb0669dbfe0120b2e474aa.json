The structure is wide with 29 clinical/event fields (IDs like op_id/subject_id/hadm_id, demographics, procedure codes, and multiple timestamps such as opstart_time/opend_time, admission/discharge, ICU in/out, death times), which is characteristic of transactional patient-operation records. Sample values are numeric IDs and time-like numbers, not long descriptive text; there are no columns resembling [field_name, description, unit, type].",
