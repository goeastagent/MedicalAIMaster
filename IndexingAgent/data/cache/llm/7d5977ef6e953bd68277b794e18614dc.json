In most enterprise contexts it refers to operational activities/processes, which are typically captured as event/transaction records. Suggested level is mid-hierarchy (e.g., visit/admission-equivalent) because 'operations' often aggregates multiple operational events rather than individual-level entities or low-level measurements.",
