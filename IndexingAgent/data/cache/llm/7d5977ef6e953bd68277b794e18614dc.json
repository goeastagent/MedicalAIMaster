In most enterprise contexts it refers to operational activities/processes, which are commonly modeled as event/transactional data (often at a visit/admission/case-like level rather than patient-level). Low confidence due to lack of domain qualifiers (e.g., clinical vs manufacturing vs IT operations).",
